For the Heron Coding Challenge, my goal was to improve the existing file classification system to better handle poorly named files, scale across industries, and process larger volumes of documents. The current classifier had some limitations, particularly with inconsistent file naming, generalizing to different industries, and handling high volumes of data.

Part 1: Enhancing the Classifier

### Enhancements
To address these challenges, I made several key improvements:

1. XGBoost Classifier: I upgraded the core model to XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm that is known for its efficiency and scalability. XGBoost performs better than simpler models on large and complex datasets, which is critical when processing high volumes of files.

2. Text-Ada002 Semantic Embeddings: To better handle poorly named files, I integrated Text-Ada002 for semantic embeddings. This model converts file names into high-dimensional vectors that capture the semantic meaning behind them. Even when the file names are ambiguous or inconsistently formatted, the model can still understand the underlying context and classify them accurately.

There are indeed some opensource replacement for this, but I use openAI.

3. Industry Flexibility: By using semantic embeddings, the classifier can adapt to various industries. The embeddings allow the model to generalize across different terminologies and categories, making it easier to extend the classifier to new domains.

Part 2: Productionising the Classifier
### Ensuring Robustness and Reliability
1. FastAPI for Performance: I replaced the existing Flask-based architecture with FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework. FastAPI is asynchronous, which allows the system to handle requests much faster and scale better under heavy loads, making it ideal for production environments.

2. add test cases for classifier: add common test cases in test_classifier.py for testing before publishing.

3. Docker for Scalability: To facilitate deployment and scaling, I created a Dockerfile to containerize the application. This makes it easy to deploy the classifier anywhere â€” whether on local machines, cloud platforms, or in a large-scale production environment. Docker ensures that the system is portable and consistent across different environments.
